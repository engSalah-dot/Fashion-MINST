# Predicting Water Temperature from Salinity Using Linear Regression

This mini project uses a dataset of oceanographic measurements to build a simple linear regression model that predicts **water temperature** based on **salinity levels**.

## 📊 Dataset
The data was sourced from the `bottle.csv` dataset which contains water quality measurements.

## 🔧 Steps:
- Cleaned and filtered the dataset
- Selected two attributes: Salinity (`Salnty`) and Temperature (`T_degC`)
- Visualized data using Seaborn
- Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and RMSE

## 📈 Results:
- **R² Score:** ~0.85
- **MAE:** 1.43
- **RMSE:** 2.27

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 💡 Notes
This is a simple project for practice and learning purposes.
